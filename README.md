<h2>🎮 Stellara (Unity) </h2> 
<h2>✒️ Description </h2>
Stellara is a 2D platformer made with Unity and C#. I created 3 simple levels for players to go through. I focused on creating a loosly coupled game by using interfaces and C# events to make my systems more scalable and independent. I also implemented a singleton pattern for my sound manager to learn about singletons.
